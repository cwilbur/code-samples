## Experience

### Instructor, Web Design Immersive, General Assembly, South Boston, MA, April 2015 to July 2015

As part of a team of three instructors, supported by a teaching
coach and a curriculum designer, taught a twelve week “boot camp”
class for aspiring software developers.  Topics and techniques
covered in the class included version control with Git,
object-oriented and higher-order functional Javascript; event-driven
programming focusing on jQuery; building and consuming REST
services, using the Ruby on Rails API backed by PostgreSQL and
Node.js with Express backed by MongoDB; asynchronous programming,
using callbacks, promises, and async.js to manage complex
asynchronous processes; and the basics of Angular.js as a full MVC
development environment entirely in the browser.

### Software Engineer IV, Cengage Learning, South Boston, MA, June 2013 to October 2014

inconsistencies in course data; to the Course and Section Management
project, aimed to enrich MindTap courses to be used with a broader
variety of instructional structures, including several sections
being taught in parallel, a lead instructor with several assistants,
or an instructor with a student teaching assistant.  While doing
this, I also mentored more junior colleagues in Scrum and Agile, in
test-driven development, and in good software engineering practices.

Principal technologies used included Javascript, including Node,
Grunt, Jasmine, jQuery, JavascriptMVC (later renamed to CanJS), and
AngularJS; MySQL and Mongo as databases; HTML5 and CSS; Jenkins for
