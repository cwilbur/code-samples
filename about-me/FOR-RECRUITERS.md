I prepared this document because I am frequently contacted by
recruiters. It started out as a response to one recruiter, and
when I found myself cutting and pasting it in response to other
recruiters, I decided to put it online.

I prefer to communicate by email, because it gives me time to
think and respond when I have a few minutes and doesn't require
coordinating my schedule with someone else's.

These are my hard requirements for a position:

## It must be accessible by public transit.

I live on the Ashmont branch of the Red Line and don't own a car.
This means that Cambridge, the Financial District, Back Bay,
Somerville are all accessible.  Waltham and Burlington are not.  (If
you are a recruiter working from outside the Boston area, feel free to
ask about specific locations; Boston public transit is quirky in ways
that aren't obvious, and you won't impress me by trying to fake
knowledge you don't have.  Especially if you get it wrong.)

## Java is a non-starter.

I don't care for Java.  I have spent the past 17 years assiduously
avoiding Java, and more importantly the corporate culture of
cog-in-a-machine programming and centralized command and control that
Java has engendered.  I see little reason to change that now,
especially as dynamic languages are starting to prove that they can
easily outperform Java in the hands of competent programmers.  I will
work with people who are writing Java, and I started my career by
reading and explicating Java stack traces to Java developers; I have
just come to the conclusion that my time is much more efficiently
spent elsewhere.

(I am actually willing to consider working in Java if you have a
position that uses Java without subscribing to dysfunctional Java
culture.  I know such positions exist, but they're few and far
between.)

## Windows on the server is a non-starter.

I don't do Windows on the server.  I started in Unix and Linux, and I
have continued in the open source stack.  I've spent my entire career
working on Unixlikes and open source platforms, and there's no
material benefit to me or to a potential employer for me to switch
now.

("Unixlike" includes Linux, Solaris, FreeBSDs, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
the BSD derivatives, including Mac OS X.)

## Windows on the desktop means a culture clash.

I will not use Windows as a primary desktop.  Given that I'm not
working with Windows servers, the requirement that my desktop be
Windows is a sign of a hidebound and needlessly conformist central IT
organization.  Both Mac OS X and Linux will integrate smoothly with
Exchange email and calendaring, which is often the principal
requirement for Windows in the enterprise in the first place.

## I want to work with professional software engineers, not mavericks, ninjas, cowboys, or rock stars.

The company must demonstrate a commitment to good software engineering
practices and to evidence-based decisionmaking. I will ask in the interview
about the use of version control and bug tracking software, and I am looking
for best practices like continuous integration and automated testing,
developers writing code and tests simultaneously, and the like.  A good
starting point for a high-level view is Joel Spolsky's article at
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html is an excellent
place to start, although it is showing its age and bias in that it was written
with desktop software in mind, before the broad acceptance of agile
development methodologies.

## The more independent customers, the better -- or B2B = BS

When a company sells a product to another company, the focus is on courting
the primary decisionmaker, and the more expensive the product, the more status
and ego get in the way of quality and evidence-based decisionmakingq.  When a
company sells a product to the public at large or has to compete for dozens of
contracts, ignoring quality and evidence is corporate suicide.

# What I really want

Aside from that, what I'm looking for is a senior or lead software
engineer, team lead, or architect position, working preferably in Perl
or Javascript (although Python and Ruby are acceptable; PHP is not).
My strongest technical skills are mainly in the application logic
layers from the database or storage layer through to the user
interface, and I am enough of a generalist that I can and have worked
successfully on every layers from database stored procedures to event-
driven UI.  I am not a data architect, graphic designer, or user
experience expert, but I have worked closely with all three before to
translate their visions into code.  I work best in heterogenous, self-
organizing teams, using Agile processes; I do not work well in rigid
command-and-control hierarchies. You can see my resume at
https://github.com/cwilbur/code-samples/raw/master/Charlton-Wilbur-resume.pdf

The short-term nature of some of the positions on my resume are of
concern to some recruiters and some hiring managers, and I am prepared
to discuss this in detail.  However, as a broad outline, i will note
that in 2003 I decided that I would pursue consulting for a few years
while I prepared myself to return to graduate school for a Ph.D. in
music.  By 2005 I had realized that I did not have the temperament or
aptitude for salesmanship to work successfully as an independent
consultant.  Also, I had re-evaluated the economics of academia and
realized that an academic career was likely to involve a lot of
frustration and very little lucre -- I could give up the next five
years of earning potential to get a Ph.D., and then if I was lucky,
land a job making one-third to one-half of what I could make in
software -- and decided to work on a software engineering career in
earnest.

All that said, if you have a position that you think will suit me, I'm
happy to hear about it.
